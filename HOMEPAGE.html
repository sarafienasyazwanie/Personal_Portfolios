<br> Hello, you lovely people.

<p> This is where I'm going to share a little bit about my life with you.
<br> I hope you will enjoy the reading as much as I enjoyed the writing.
<br> Here I want to share with you one of my favorite article that I read.

<p>When you're growing up you're told to dream big, reach for the stars, and you can be whatever you want to be. 
<br> More than likely you have big dreams for yourself: being a doctor, a teacher, an attorney, the list can go on forever. 
<br> Sometimes society steps in and tells you that your dreams are too big. You wonder how a dream can be too big? 
<br> The thought and possible action may even come to give up on that dream. You should never give up on your dreams. </br> </p>

<p> At some point in your life, someone has looked at you and said your dreams (or aspirations) are not possible for you because you are a girl. 
<br> Don't ever listen to them. First, no one but you knows what you are capable of doing. No one knows the drive you may have for chasing after a goal of yours. 
<br>Find ways to prove that person wrong. Just because you are a girl doesn't mean you're incapable of having big dreams.
</p> </br>

<p> If you're lucky you will find someone to share your big dream with and they will back you 110%. 
<br> They could be a life long friend, a parent, a mentor, a significant other, but no matter the case they believe in you. 
<br> They believe that you can not only make your dream come true but that you will be successful doing it. 
<br> They will encourage you to chase these dreams, to take the steps needed to fulfill them. 
<br> Most importantly they will be happy for you when you achieve this dream. They will be in your corner literally cheering you on. 
<br> This 'someone' or maybe multiple someones will be ecstatic when you become closer to achieving your dream. 
<br> That's the kind of positivity you need in your life.
</p> </br>

<p> Once you are sure that this is the path you want to set out on, don't look back. 
<br> Don't doubt yourself. And most importantly don't give up. Even though you have an amazing support system behind you, 
<br> they can't take the steps for you to achieve these dreams you have. You're the one who has to take action and make a path for yourself. 
<br> It may not always be easy, and it may not always be fun. But if this is something that you are truly passionate about 
<br> then you should definitely be ready to put in the work. You need to realize that you need to motivate yourself also. 
<br> You have chosen this path to go down and it is up to you to make it happen.
</p> </br>

<p> For a lot of people, these dreams and goals are not short term ones. Be ready to settle in for the long haul.
<br>You may be looking at a lot of school time to help achieve your dream. This can be long term for you, you will get your Bachelor's degree, 
<br> then you may move onto a specialty. You could move on to law school, medical school, a masters program and then even a doctorate. 
<br> Be ready for reading and studying, it may seem annoying at that moment, but in the long haul, it is going to help you achieve your dream. 
<br> You're going to be putting in a lot of work to make your dreams come true, but it will be so worth it.
</p> </br>

<p> Don't let people bring you down. You will face all kinds of adversity while achieving these big dreams for yourself. 
<br> Some people may look at you and say you're crazy for wanting to do this, but they don't know you. 
<br> They don't know what you are capable of doing and how long you have wanted this. 
<br> Keep your head up and know that you can do whatever you set your mind too. 
<br> This will just be a bump in the road for you, so let it roll off you. 
<br> There are so many reasons why someone may want to bring your hopes down on achieving your dream. 
<br>  They could be jealous of your willpower to move on, could be that they wish they had the confidence you do. 
<br>  Keep moving forward and never look back.
